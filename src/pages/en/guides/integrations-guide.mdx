**Astro Integrations** add new functionality and behaviors for your project with only a few lines of code. You can write a custom integration yourself, use an official integration, or use integrations built by the community.

Integrations can…

- Unlock React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and other popular UI frameworks.
- Integrate tools like Tailwind, and Partytown with a few lines of code.
- Add new features to your project, like automatic sitemap generation.
- Write custom code that hooks into the build process, dev server, and more.

## Automatic Integration Setup

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of integrations.

:::caution
We will always ask for confirmation before updating any of your files, but it never hurts to have a version-controlled backup just in case.
:::

Run the `astro add` command using the package manager of your choice and our automatic integration wizard will update your configuration file and install any necessary dependencies.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add react
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpx astro add react
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add react
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

It's even possible to configure multiple integrations at the same time!

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add react tailwind partytown
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpx astro add react tailwind partytown
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add react tailwind partytown
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

:::note[Handling Integration Dependencies]
If you see any warnings like `Cannot find package '[package-name]'` after adding an integration, your package manager may not have installed [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) for you. To install these missing packages, run `npm install [package-name]`.
:::

## Using Integrations

Astro integrations are always added through the `integrations` property in your  `astro.config.mjs` file.

There are three common ways to import an integration into your Astro project:
1. Installing an npm package integration.
2. Import your own integration from a local file inside your project.
3. Write your integration inline, directly in your config file.

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import {defineConfig} from 'astro/config';
import installedIntegration from '@astrojs/vue';
import localIntegration from './my-integration.js';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    // 1. Imported from an installed npm package
    installedIntegration(),
    // 2. Imported from a local JS file
    localIntegration(),
    // 3. An inline object
    {name: 'namespace:id', hooks: { /* ... */ }},
  ]
})
```

Check out the [Integration API](/en/reference/integrations-reference/) reference to learn all of the different ways that you can write an integration.

### Custom Options

Integrations are almost always authored as factory functions that return the actual integration object. This lets you pass arguments and options to the factory function that customize the integration for your project.

```js
integrations: [
  // Example: Customize your integration with function arguments
  sitemap({filter: true})
]
```

### Toggle an Integration

Falsy integrations are ignored, so you can toggle integrations on & off without worrying about left-behind `undefined` and boolean values.

```js
integrations: [
  // Example: Skip building a sitemap on Windows
  process.platform !== 'win32' && sitemap()
]
```

## Finding More Integrations

You can find many integrations developed by the community in the [Astro Integrations Directory](https://astro.build/integrations/). Follow links there for detailed usage and configuration instructions.

## Building Your Own Integration

Astro's Integration API is inspired by Rollup and Vite, and designed to feel familiar to anyone who has ever written a Rollup or Vite plugin before.

This example shows how to create a simple integration to get fimiliar with the API.

### Project Setup

Create a `integration.ts` file under an `lib` directory. This file would hold all of the code for our integration.

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - **lib/**
    - **integration.ts**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

### Importing Types

Since we're using TypeScript for our example we'll start out by importing Astro's built in type for integrations.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"
import type { AstroIntegration } from 'astro';
```

[`AstroIntegration`](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#quick-api-reference) acts as a reference for you to build your own integration.

### Writing Our Integration

To make the integration work, we would have to export a function that the user can call from their `astro.config,mjs` file.

This function returns an `AstroIntegration` type.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"

export default function int_test(options: testOptions): AstroIntegration {
  name: 'awesome-intigration',
}

```

### Using Hooks

Astro comes with a bunch of [hooks](/en/reference/integrations-reference/#hooks) that you can use during the lifecycle of the website. These hooks allow us to fire certain functions when an event starts. Hooks come with a bunch of parameters that can be used in their callback functions.

Hooks can be called in the `integration.ts` file to invoke various functions.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"

export default function int_test(): AstroIntegration {
  name: 'awesome-intigration',
  hooks: {
    'astro:config:setup': () => {},
    'astro:config:done': () => {},
    'astro:server:setup': () => {}
    /* Read about the rest of the hooks at https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/#hooks  */
  }
}


```
`astro:config:setup` runs when the `dev` or `build` server is started. This hook can be used to inject routes, make changes to the config or make custom user configs.

Let's add a simple callback function to our first hook.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"

hooks: {
    'astro:config:setup': ({command}) => {
      console.log(`astro:config:setup> running command: ${command}`);   
    },
}

```

`command` returns what command is being run. It can be either `build` or `dev`.

### Running the Integration

The integration has to be imported to the `astro.config.mjs` file for it to be able to run.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {2, 4}

import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import awesome from './src/lib/integration';

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [awesome()],
});

```

Running `npm run dev` would print the following to the console.

```
astro:config:setup> running command: dev
```

### Extending The Integration

In order to make your integration really come to life, you might want to add a few features. In the examples below, you can learn how to set up user config and inject routes.

#### User Config

You may need the user to configure various data for your integration. For example the config in [TailWind](/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/#configuration) integration.

To get typesafety in the integration, we can create a type.

:::note
Creating a type is optional, however recommended so that the users can get IntelliSense and typesafety for when they use your integration.
:::

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"

type AwesomeType = {
  name: string
}

```

Now, you can pass a parameter to your function with this type.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts" /options: AwesomeType/

export default function int_test(options: AwesomeType): AstroIntegration { /* Code is poetry */ }

```

The function is now typesafe.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {6}

import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import awesome from './src/lib/integration';

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [awesome(
      name: "Neel"
    )],
});

```

The parameter `options` can be referenced anywhere in the hooks of the integration.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts"

hooks: {
    'astro:config:setup': ({command}) => {
      console.log(`astro:config:setup> running command: ${command}`); 
      console.log(`Hello there, ${options.name}!`);
    },
}

```
Restarting the server would print this to the console.

```
astro:config:setup> running command: dev
Hello there, Neel!
```

#### Injecting Routes

As started before, custom routes can be injected to the a user's site. This is particularly useful when to create admin panels or dashboards.

The route page can be a `.astro` file.

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - lib/
    - integration.ts
    - **Inject.astro**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

```astro title="/src/lib/Inject.astro"

<h1>I've been injected!</h1>

```

Route injections happen in the `astro:config:setup` hook.

`injectRoute` option is required in order to inject a route.

```ts title="/src/lib/integration.ts" /injectRoute/

hooks: {
    'astro:config:setup': ({command, injectRoute}) => {
      /* Code is poetry */
    },
}

```
`injectRoute()` contains two parameters:
- `pattern` - The path of the route
- `entryPoint` - The `.astro` file that needs to be rendered on the given path

```ts

hooks: {
    'astro:config:setup': ({command, injectRoute}) => {
      
      console.log(`astro:config:setup> running command: ${command}`); 
      console.log(`Hello there, ${options.name}!`);

      injectRoute({
        pattern: '/injected',
        entryPoint: '/src/lib/Inject.astro',
      });

   },
}

```

Restarting the server and visiting `/injected` path would render the contents of the `.astro` file.
